------



CTRA embeds information-sharing libraries that are common to other raid addons, to ensure the widest compatibility.

However, to protect personal privacy, these embedded libraries are modified with an opt-out feature.
CTRA users can choose not to activate the libraries via the /ctra options menu.

This ensures that any information transmitted about your character (durability, spellcasts, etc) is done with your full consent.




Note: Deselecting a feature simply stops CTRA from installing the library.  Nothing prevents other addons from using the exact same library.
If the library is installed by another addon, CTRA will not interfere and may even use the information source (even if you had opted out).

Thus, if you truly wish to opt out, you must also uninstall other addons who don't give an opt-out option like CTRA does.




No changes to the embedded libraries are made other than this opt-in/out capability, at the top and bottom of each file.
The CTMod team acknowledges the library authors at the top of each file, and appologizes if this has inadvertently
violated the spirit of any license.
