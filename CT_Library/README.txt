-- Overall CTMod license

CTMod remains "all rights reserved"; specifically, 
it is requested to contact the team before modifying or redistributing.

The CTMod team has included the following individuals over time:
- Cide (original team member)
- TS (original team member)
- Resike (since 2014)
- Dahk Celes / DDCorkum (since 2017)

CTMod is currently distributed through GitHub, CurseForge, WoWInterface and Wago.



------------------------------
-- CT_Library

CT_Library embeds the following addon libraries:
- LibStub by Kaelten et al. (public domain)
- LibDeflate by Haoqian He (zlib license)
- AceSerializer-3.0 by Nevcairiel et al. (see Libs\Ace3\Ace3-License.txt)
- TaintLess by foxlit (unmodified distribution of xml authorized)

To limit download sizes, CT_Library excludes extra files from each library
such as tutorials/instructions or .xml and .toc files that simply point 
to the main code in the .lua.   Please contact the CTMod team if you need 
any help to find these original files from the library authors.
(Hint: they are all on CurseForge, WoWI, or TLY.)



------------------------------
-- CT_RaidAssist

CT_RaidAssist embeds the following addon libraries:
- LibDurability by funkehdude (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0)
- LibHealComm by Shadowed, Azilroka and xbeebs (license unknown), which includes CallbackHandler by nevcairiel (BSD license) and ChatThrottleLib by Mikk (license unknown)

These libraries permit CT_RaidAssist to share info with other raid addons
for common tasks like durability and predicting incoming heals in WoW Classic.

Using a common library allows users more freedom to choose any
compatible addon, so they do not feel pressured to use any
particular one (CT or otherwise) to participate in a raiding guild.

Former versions of CT_RaidAssist included an opt-out feature so users could refrain from
installing these data-sharing libraries.  However, this has been removed since it is
not known that any user actually made use of this opt-out feature.
